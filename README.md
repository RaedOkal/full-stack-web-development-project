#Project Description:

This GitHub project showcases an online book store with comprehensive functionality, including user login and registration forms. The project incorporates an engaging homepage that dynamically displays the latest books from the database and the most recent categories. Users can easily add desired books to their shopping carts.

The shopping cart feature utilizes the GET method to match the selected book's ID from the books table and seamlessly insert it into the carts table. The cart page then retrieves and displays the selected items for a convenient overview of the user's current selections.

Moreover, the project includes an admin login system that grants access to the dashboard page. Within the dashboard, administrators possess the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and categories. These operations empower the admin to efficiently manage and maintain the online store's inventory.

To develop this project, a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP was employed. This tech stack facilitated the creation of an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly online book store, ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers and streamlined administration for the site's staff.
